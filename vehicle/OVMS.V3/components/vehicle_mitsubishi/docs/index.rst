==================================== ==================

Note that some metrics are polled at different rates than others and some metrics are not available when car is off. This means that after a restart of the OVMS, some metrics will be missing until the car is turned on and maybe driven for few minutes.

Trio Regen Brake Light Hack
---------------------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Parts required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* 1x DA26 / Sub-D 26HD Plug & housing
  * Note: housings for Sub-D 15 fit for 26HD
  * e.g. Assmann-WSW-A-HDS-26-LL-Z
  * Encitech-DPPK15-BK-K-D-SUB-Gehaeuse
* 1x 12V Universal Car Relay + Socket
  * e.g. Song-Chuan-896H-1CH-C1-12V-DC-Kfz-Relais
  * GoodSky-Relaissockel-1-St.-GRL-CS3770
* 1x 1 Channel 12V Relay Module With Optocoupler Isolation
  * 12V 1 channel relay module with Optocoupler Isolation  

Car wire-tap connectors, car crimp connectors, 0.5 mm² wires, zipties, shrink-on tube, tools

Note: if you already use the switched 12V output of the OVMS for something different, you can use one of the free EGPIO outputs. That requires additionally routing an EGPIO line to the DA26 connector at the expansion slot (e.g. using a jumper) and using a relay module (2/b: relay shield) with separate power input instead of the standard car relay.

I use 2/b (relay shield) variant: Be aware the MAX71317 outputs are open drain, so you need a pull up resistor to e.g. +3.3. According to the data sheet, the current should stay below 6 mA.

Inside OVMS Box: Connect JP1 Pin10 (GEP7) to Pin12 (EGPIO_8) with jumper

In DA26 connector::

  pin 24(+3.3) ----- [ 680 Ohms ] ---+--- [ Relay board IN ]                                   		
                                     |
                            pin 21 (EGPIO_8)
  pin 9 ----- [Relay board DC+]
  pin 8 ----- [Relay board DC-]
  [Relay board COM] ----- Brake pedal switch one side
  [Relay board NO] ----- Brake pedal switch other side

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See OVMS web user interface, menu Trio → Brake Light:

Set the port as necessary and the checkbox to enable the brakelight.

For monitoring and fine tuning, use the „regenmon“ web plugin:
