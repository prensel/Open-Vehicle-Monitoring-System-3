## Basics

The OVMS web framework is based on HTML 5, Bootstrap 3 and jQuery 3. Plenty documentation and guides on these basic web technologies is available on the web, a very good resource is [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/).

For charts the framework includes Highcharts 6. Info and documentation on this is available on [Highcharts.com](https://www.highcharts.com/).

The framework is "AJAX" based. The index page `/` loads the framework assets and defines a default container structure including a `#menu` and a `#main` container. Content pages are loaded into the `#main` container. The window URL includes the page URL after the hash mark `#`:

  - `http://ovms.local/#/status` – this loads page `/status` into `#main`
  - `http://ovms.local/#/dashboard?nm=1` – this loads the dashboard and activates night mode

Links and forms having id targets `#…` are automatically converted to AJAX by the framework:

  - `<a href="/edit?path=/sd/index.txt" target="#main">Edit index.txt</a>` – load the editor

Pages can be loaded outside the framework as well (e.g. `http://ovms.local/status`). See index source on framework scripts and styles to include if you'd like to design standalone pages using the framework methods.

If file system access is enabled, all URLs not handled by the system or a user plugin (see below) are mapped onto the file system under the configured web root. Of course, files can be loaded into the framework as well. For example, if the web root is `/sd` (default):

  - `http://ovms.local/#/mypage.htm` – load file `/sd/mypage.htm` into `#main`
  - `http://test1.local/#/logs` – load directory listing `/sd/logs` into `#main`

**Important Note**: the framework has a global shared context (i.e. the `window` object). To avoid polluting the global context with local variables, good practice is to wrap your local scripts into closures. Pattern:

    <script>
    (function(){
      … insert your code here …
    })();
    </script>


## Authorization

Page access can be restricted to authorized users either session based or per access. File access can be restricted using digest authentication.

The module password is used for all authorizations. A user account or API key administration is not yet included, the main username is `admin`.

To create a session, call the `/login` page and store the resulting cookie:

  1. `curl -c auth -b auth 'http://192.168.4.1/login' -d username=admin -d password=…`
  2. `curl -c auth -b auth 'http://192.168.4.1/api/execute?command=xrt+cfg+info'`

To issue a single call, e.g. to execute a command from a Wifi button, supply the password as `apikey`:

  - `curl 'http://192.168.4.1/api/execute?apikey=password&command=xrt+cfg+info'`


## User Plugins

The framework supports installing user content as pages or extensions to pages. To install an example:

  1. Menu Config → Web Plugins
  2. Add plugin: type "Page", name e.g. "dev.metrics" (used as the file name in `/store/plugin`)
  3. Save → Edit
  4. Set page to e.g. "/usr/dev/metrics", label to e.g. "Dev: Metrics"
  5. Set the menu to e.g. "Tools" and auth to e.g. "None"
  6. Paste the page source into the content area
  7. Save → the page is now accessible in the "Tools" menu.

Hint: use the standard editor (tools menu) in a second session to edit a plugin repeatedly during test / development.
