This plugin has been added to the Twizy code. It's used here as a more complex
example of what can be done by plugins.

It's a full featured SEVCON tuning profile editor including dialogs to load & save
profiles from the OVMS configuration and to create & read base64 profile codes.

See Twizy documentation for details on tuning profiles and capabilities.

**Install**: not necessary if vehicle Twizy is configured (see "Twizy" menu). If
you'd like to test this for another vehicle, add as a ``page`` plugin e.g. ``/test/profed``.
