/**
 * canlog is the general interface and base implementation for all can loggers.
 *  It provides standard methods to open files and configure message filters
 *  to the CAN framework command "can log".
 *
 * Specific log formats are implemented as sub classes of canlog. Add them
 *  to the type list & method Instantiate(). See canlog_trace & canlog_crtd
 *  for examples & reference.
 *
 * Log messages are sent to a canlog through a queue handled by a separate
 *  task for the logger, so logging doesn't affect CAN framework speed and
 *  a log can be written/streamed to a slow medium.
 *
 * Log entries can be frames, status or info messages (see CAN_LogEntry_t).
 * The timestamp of the original event is preserved.
 *
 * Note: loggers get messages for all interfaces, if a log format does not
 *  allow multiple buses within a file, the logger needs to manage a set
 *  of files or may return false on Open() without a bus filter.
